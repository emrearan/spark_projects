# spark_projects

This project includes ETL processes. It is intended to help those who want to code on Spark.

First of all, Pokemon data is used to show ETL structure. It includes basic ETL operations in both Python and Scala languages. Both of them give the same results. You can compare these languages and code/convert your Spark ETL jobs.
